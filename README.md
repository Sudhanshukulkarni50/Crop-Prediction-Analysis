# 🌾 Crop Prediction Analysis

## 📝 Overview
The **Crop Prediction Analysis** project leverages machine learning to predict suitable crops based on environmental and soil parameters. 
This model helps farmers optimize crop selection, improving yields and reducing risks associated with crop farming.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – for data analysis and machine learning model implementation  
- **Scikit-learn** – for training the machine learning model  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis and model training

## 📊 Key Features
- 🌱 Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**  
- 🧮 Feature selection based on soil and environmental parameters  
- 📊 Visualizing crop suitability based on key factors using **Seaborn**  
- 🤖 Training and testing a machine learning model (Random Forest, Decision Tree) to predict the best crop  
- 📈 Accuracy evaluation using metrics like **accuracy score**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**
